# Acceptance

Runtime compatibility is accepted only from black-box evidence against the pinned Python Streamlit 1.66.1 browser trace. Source inspection, compilation, health checks, AppTest, or a same-name Rust function can never imply compatibility.

The 1.66.1 runtime migration adds Rust regressions in `streamlit/tests/runtime/mod.rs` (loaded by the server module): health/host-config HTTP responses, unchanged index/JavaScript serving, a fresh two-entry WS handshake, four reruns including two button triggers and a reset, and heartbeat responses after each run. The real official-frontend [Rust button smoke](../tests/browser/rust-smoke/trace-smoke.json) records 36 frames and three clicks, each with a same-connection true trigger followed by `script_finished` status 0. This is retained UI/wire evidence for the minimal button demo, not completion of an upload journey, session restoration, or security-handshake compatibility; see [known compatibility gaps](compatibility.md).

## Long-term acceptance

2026-10-27 确认的长期目标以完整原生 Rust Streamlit 为交付，阶段见 [roadmap](roadmap.md#long-term-milestones)。历史页面矩阵和原有旅程只证明各自已测范围；它们不是完整功能分母，也不证明当前修改后的程序已通过相同验证。

| 层面 | 最终需提供的证据 |
|---|---|
| 功能与适用性 | 官方用户文档的功能、子能力、配置和使用流程盘点，保留文档版本与 1.66.1 运行参考版本；Rust 可使用不同接口和实现，源码仅核实行为；每项适用能力实现并接通，不适用及有意差异经审查或必要用户决策。 |
| 正确性与兼容 | 默认值、返回值、状态、异常、边界及重要组合的回归；涉及界面的能力使用官方前端和参考差分；缺陷有修复前后可定位证据。 |
| 完整应用 | 上传、筛选、选择、编辑、图表、导航、组件和实时更新等应用流程；包含空集、替换、恢复、重连及会话隔离。 |
| 架构与资源 | 会话、运行、widget、缓存、上传和媒体的职责及生命周期；已测场景无未处理的串会话、失控重跑或资源持续累积问题。 |
| 性能 | 固定版本、环境和输入下的延迟、吞吐、CPU、内存、资源回收报告；说明负载与局限，性能与容量目标由证据和用户决定。 |
| 开发与分发 | 清楚且兼容的 Rust API、可运行示例、准确文档、明确支持平台和工具链、干净环境构建/安装/运行记录。 |
| 工程与 Review | 相关代码检查、单元及真实集成验证通过，逐文件 diff 复查，独立只读 Review 无未处理的阻塞发现；被替代代码与说明及时清理。 |

长期 M0 只建立盘点和基线，不要求尚未实现的能力提前通过，也不把环境失败归为产品缺陷。长期 Goal 只有在上述完成条件及确认的停止位置全部满足后才能结束；代码完成、历史记录或局部 PASS 不能代替整体验收。

本地隔离开发环境、现有固定参考依赖和构建缓存已经获执行授权；不读取真实密钥或敏感配置。用户已进一步授权及时提交、推送验收后的批次；主分支更新经 PR/MR 门禁。PR/MR 创建、合并、发布、部署及生产/数据库外部写入分别核对授权，不从提交推送授权推断。

对应能力先写面向使用者的用法和行为文档，再实现；文档中的当前能力与规划接口分开标注。关键公共接口或行为规则确认后实施，普通实现细节自主处理。

## Frozen reference data

2026-10-27 用户确认：以当前项目锁定的 Python Streamlit 1.66.1 收集参考数据，并将输入、预期结果及版本元数据固化为仓库夹具，作为后续 Rust 单元和协议回归依据。已有且身份匹配的冻结数据直接复用，不因 Rust 改动或 checkout 目录变化反复采集 Python。

首次新增行为、参考版本升级或证据确实失效时补充采集，记录参考包身份、输入和配置、输出、原始观察及允许的规范化。后续测试直接重放；不得从待测 Rust 实现生成自己的预期，或为了转绿修改冻结结果。涉及界面的能力保留初始官方前端差分证据，必要时验证当前 Rust 界面；不要求每次重采 Python。

用户进一步明确取消源码 SHA 限制：不计算或校验 Rust、Python 参考应用、采集器及判定器源码的 SHA 作为测试或兼容门禁，不因源码变化强制重采数据，也不为保留此限制增加历史源码归档。版本号和 Git 提交只用于追溯，正确性由冻结输入输出、协议和实际交互证明。旧轨迹中的源码 SHA 保留作历史元数据，不再作为当前判定条件；功能检查数量必须如实反映实际检查，不能保留空检查凑数。

数据夹具、截图、Arrow/HTTP payload 和发行包的完整性校验与源码门禁分开处理；媒体地址及 widget/page 标识的协议哈希属于功能行为，不能在清理源码限制时一并删除。新采集记录参考版本与输入配置，不再增加源码指纹门槛。

历史 J09-S4 的 Python 配置、命令行与有效配置可共同核实 120 秒；Rust 的旧记录只声明该值，移除源码快照门槛后，保留材料不能独立重证精确的有效 TTL。实际断线至少 135 秒后换会话并重置状态仍有冻结行为证据。重放检查据此使用 `recorded_ttl120`，不把旧 Rust 记录当作当前配置证明。

取消源码门槛后的当前冻结数据回归为 1488 项通过（`pytest tests/reference`）；forms 采集/证据映射专项另有 53 项通过。26 个通用合同的必需检查总数由 264 减为 238，删除源码身份检查而非保留空检查。此次没有重新采集 Python 行为或修改原始输入输出；96 条 Pillow 弃用告警仍待后续维护。

旧机器绝对路径属于采集来源。重放必须通过当前仓库的受控相对路径、大小和 SHA 定位数据夹具，继续校验上传动作、HTTP payload 与运行关联，不静默重写原始轨迹。CSV 重放已有受控路径映射与错误目录、错误文件、路径遍历及内容变化的回归；其他历史路径仍按各自证据检查，不能据此宣称全部旧轨迹可跨目录重放。

## Rust error handling

Rust 禁止使用 `.unwrap()`；工作区 Clippy 配置 `unwrap_used = deny`，两个 crate 继承并覆盖全部目标，包括示例和测试。错误按现有返回类型正常传播，测试以明确断言表达预期，不通过批量替换 `.expect()`、增加 lint 豁免或通用 panic 提取器规避要求。需要改变公共错误接口时提交用户决策。

2026-10-27 当前迁移已通过格式检查、全目标 Clippy、工作区测试（151 库测试、1 journey ledger、2 rustdoc）及示例测试（11 项）。独立只读 Review 已复核迁移、查询参数重跑/切页边界与首个运行控制信号规则；这些结果不代替全部功能和浏览器兼容验收。原始日志见本地 `target/checks/m0-baseline/` 中的 `*-integrated.log`。

Q3 默认状态补证后的整合验证按代码检查、单元、集成顺序执行：格式与全目标 Clippy 通过；76 项纯库单元、76 项真实 HTTP/WS、1 项旅程清单、2 项 rustdoc 通过。新回归直接读取冻结的 Python 四轮输入输出，并增加注明为 Rust 内部边界的空输入保留检查。修前失败与修后日志见 `target/checks/q3-componentv2/`；此条不扩展到完整组件兼容。

## Required fresh-checkout checks

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/reference -q
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

The journey manifest is validated by the Rust `journey_ledger` integration test inside `cargo test`; the former `validate_journeys.py` was removed because repository tests live in Rust unless they must drive the pinned Python reference or a real Chrome.

The official docs cache is an ignored input under `target/upstream/docs`; when present, `tools/fetch_upstream.py` and `tools/verify_p0.py` can audit it and regenerate the two compatibility JSON files. These tools are optional local-cache checks, not fresh-checkout gates. `fetch_upstream.py --download` restores only the three locked archives and cannot reconstruct the captured catalog or HTML cache. If that cache is absent, do not run these two tools or claim that they automatically rebuild it.

## Gates

- Upstream artifacts and the documentation catalog match every hash in `upstream.lock.json`.
- The docs matrix has one row per captured canonical page with official URL, Rust plan, implementation status, compatibility status, and evidence links.
- A `partial` or `supported` compatibility status requires linked differential evidence. `supported` additionally requires API, wire, and official-frontend browser evidence.
- Failed or partial browser attempts retain their real artifacts and a failure reason; an unrun journey remains `not_run` with no attempt artifacts.
- No HTTP/WS differential failure is accepted. AppTest results are script-level oracle evidence and cannot replace wire evidence.

## Remaining first-release journeys

Read current whole-journey status, measured/deferred steps and linked evidence from [the journey manifest](../tests/journeys/journeys.json), and per-feature scope/status from [the compatibility matrix](../compatibility/api-compatibility-matrix.json). `not_run` means unmeasured, not necessarily unimplemented; captured pages are not a complete feature denominator. Forms/text input were integrated in `76938fb` and the CSV-app form integration in `e28f1d3`. Their presence does not replace whole-journey evidence or authorize a feature-matrix status change.

Product behavior follows official [widget semantics](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/widget-behavior), [session state](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state), [uploader](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.file_uploader), [dataframe](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.dataframe), and [forms](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/forms). API pages currently show 1.66.0; execution evidence must use 1.66.1. CSV aggregates and literal messages below are application contracts from the [existing 10-journey / 43-step manifest](../tests/journeys/journeys.json), not claims derived from Python framework implementation.

The table below preserves acceptance obligations, not a second live progress ledger. Follow remaining work in the manifest, reusing the reviewed API/capture helpers and explicit preparations below; add implementation only when a measured failure identifies missing behavior.

| Journey | Acceptance obligation / minimum acceptance |
|---|---|
| J01 (5 steps) | Ordered category/region/channel aggregates, Unicode keys, BOM-equivalent output. Existing upload/dataframe methods cover the core; require 5/5 original assertions, cell-by-cell Arrow/DOM agreement and 0 BOM leaks. Establish the grouping reset needed before the Unicode replacement cases. |
| J02 (5) | Preserve the other controls while filtering, exclude the two unknown keys, inclusive amount threshold, then category regrouping. Require 5/5 assertions; each ordinary changed control causes exactly one run/completion and runs delta +1; absent groups must not become zero rows. |
| J03 (4) | Table/chart update in the same run, order/value geometry and removal of stale/empty chart. Require 4/4 assertions, table row count = bar count, value-proportional bars, and no chart element/DOM at the empty stage. Shared Vega wire does not prove every chart API. |
| J04 (4) | S1-S3 stay as originally verified. S4 is the measured execution-semantics step: one guarded `st.rerun()` aborts its run with `FINISHED_EARLY_FOR_RERUN` and the server starts the next run without a browser request (same session, fresh run id); `st.stop()` finishes `FINISHED_SUCCESSFULLY` with every later element suppressed; both runtimes reach identical DOM end states, judged by `journey-execution-v1` with both published chains replaying 8/8/8. |
| J06 (5) | Two live contexts with upload + three pulses + filtering + A-only reload. Require 5/5 assertions: distinct IDs, 0 cross-session file/counter/result changes, A gets a fresh ID on reload and B keeps its ID/state. Earlier counter-only isolation does not prove this combined journey. |
| J09 (4; S4 measured and passed 2026-10-25) | Fresh two-entry handshake, genuine disconnect followed by three-entry same-ID recovery preserving two pulses and uploaded aggregation, then reload reset. Require S1-S3 3/3, both handshake headers/NewSession IDs, retained file result and DOM counters. S4 is closed by the reviewed slow-expiry round: a genuine >=135-second disconnect on both runtimes, the old-ID reconnect answered with a new session and a server-side reset, the fail-closed recovery oracle satisfied only by the two reviewed raws (both published chains replay 20/20/20, exit 0). |
| J05 (3) | Combine Note, Applied note, runs and Pulse in one session. Require 3/3: before submit no value submission and runs delta 0; submit delta +1 with hello applied and input retained; three pulses give pulses=3 and runs delta +3. Isolated note/agree fixtures do not cover this; J05 itself does not require a CSV/table. |
| J00 (6) | Final integrated title/upload/three filters/Pulse/form/counters plus aggregate/chart loop. Require 6/6 original assertions; existing component evidence does not replace this exact integrated whole-journey run. |

Explicit preparations independently passed Carver review; version them before new continuous Python/Rust capture. Keep the original 10 journeys / 42 step IDs and expected results; add these visible actions to the relevant step's preparation, with no hidden reset or expected-value rewrite:

| Step boundary | Explicit UI action and state to prove |
|---|---|
| J00-S4 | After S3's six region groups, visibly choose category while minimum=0 and include-unknown=true; await that run. Then move minimum to 100. The original two groups are now coherent: Books 1/120.50 and Games 2/349.49, two bars. |
| J00-S5 | Starting from category/100/on, visibly move minimum to 0, await completion, then choose region and await completion. Record six groups/12 rows before unchecking include-unknown; the original four known groups/9 rows and four bars must follow that click. S6 counts all preparation runs as well as the named actions. |
| J03-S3 | After S2's category/100/on two-group result, visibly reset minimum to 0 and await the restored four categories. Then choose region; verify six keys including missing/UNKNOWN, six table rows and six bars in that operation's run. S4 subsequently moves minimum to 200, retaining region/on, and must remove the chart entirely. |
| J06-S4 | First finish S3 with B still empty and A's upload + pulses=3 intact. Then upload sales_basic.csv in B with category/0/on; verify B's own four-group baseline and A unchanged. Change B's group to region, obtaining six groups while A keeps its original table/chart/counters. S5 reloads only A; B must retain its session ID, uploaded file and region result. |
| J01-S4/S5 | After channel verification, explicitly restore category/0/on before replacing the upload with Unicode CSV. Replace with the BOM equivalent under the same controls. Verify original Unicode keys, totals and ordering plus BOM equivalence; any auto-reset from replacement is an observation to record, not an assumed precondition. |

Each preparation action is real UI input with before/after control values, the target ClientState value, same-request/connection successful completion, and the resulting table/chart DOM/Arrow. For these normal changed controls, require one rerun and runs delta +1 per action; use an observed run ledger for upload/preparation rather than inventing a fixed total. Capture the dependent chain in the same page/session, including unchanged A snapshots after B operations. Require the original per-step PNGs and all original assertions; a written manifest entry alone is not acceptance. If the Python reference contradicts this proposal, retain the failure and review the contract before claiming Rust parity.

For each whole journey, verify every original assertion (100%), allow 0 unexplained missing artifacts/mismatches, and retain screenshots for every required step. Link frozen binary/source/driver/criteria provenance and actual same-connection request/completion windows to DOM/Arrow observations. Dependency-linked recovery/count steps must share session continuity. Positive raw, a PNG, or isolated API tests alone cannot close a missing guard or prove all 42 steps.

## API and wire differential obligations

These 21 obligations replace the removed interface-diff metadata file. They are acceptance requirements, not a claim of Rust compatibility. The Python browser traces under `tests/reference/reference-browser/` are the wire oracle where marked; Rust progress must be assessed per obligation against equivalent black-box evidence and recorded in the current matrix.

| ID | Surface | Rust requirement | Reference evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A01 | st.file_uploader | the Rust uploader must return the uploaded bytes unchanged and must not raise on malformed CSV | golden `G01` |
| A02 | st.selectbox | the Rust selector must expose the same option set and initial selection; the returned value must be the selected option, never an index | golden `G01` |
| A03 | st.slider | the Rust slider must clamp and quantise identically, and the filter it drives must use >= on the amount, not > | golden `G07` |
| A04 | st.checkbox | the Rust checkbox defaults to on and its false branch must apply the same unknown-region rule as the oracle | golden `G02` |
| A05 | st.button | the Rust button must return a one-shot trigger value and cause exactly one rerun per click | reference run `REF-15` |
| A06 | st.form + st.form_submit_button | the Rust form must gate its children's values on an explicit submit, and must not clear the field on submit when clear_on_submit is false | reference run `REF-16` |
| A07 | st.dataframe | the Rust dataframe must emit the same column order, the same hidden index and an empty-but-present table for the empty case | golden `G01` |
| A08 | st.altair_chart / st.vega_lite_chart | the Rust chart must be omitted entirely in the empty case, matching the oracle's absent element rather than an empty spec | reference run `REF-03` |
| A09 | st.text / st.markdown | the Rust text element must carry the same literal content so that the browser journeys can assert on it | reference run `REF-01` |
| A10 | st.session_state | the Rust session state must be per-session, survive reruns and reject assignment to a live widget key | reference run `REF-15` |
| W01 | HTTP GET /_stcore/health | the Rust server must expose the same path and body. NOTE: this is an interface probe, not a UI pass. | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/http_requests` |
| W02 | HTTP GET /_stcore/host-config | the Rust server must return the same JSON keys with the same defaults. NOTE: interface probe, not a UI pass. | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/http_requests` |
| W03 | HTTP GET / and static assets | the Rust server must serve the official frontend unmodified, byte for byte. NOTE: interface probe, not a UI pass. | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/http_requests` |
| W04 | HTTP PUT /_stcore/upload_file/{session_id}/{file_id} | the Rust upload route must accept PUT on that path shape, take the single uploaded file regardless of its field name, and answer 204 | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/upload_contract` |
| W05 | HTTP GET /media/{file_id} | the Rust media route must mirror the upstream shape. This case is out of the P0 closed loop and is carried forward, not a UI pass. CLOSED 2026-10-25: the route serves the reference's content-addressed store (BLAKE2b-128 over `"{len}:"`+data+mimetype, >1MiB head/middle/tail sampling) with the measured 200/`accept-ranges` and 206/`content-range` shapes; the byte-identical WAV fixture is served under its exact measured address. Evidence: the journey-media-v1 chain (both replays 11/11/11) plus the runtime regression in `streamlit/tests/runtime/media.rs`. | [Python media trace](../tests/reference/reference-browser/media/trace-media.json) and [Rust media trace](../tests/browser/rust-media/trace-media.json) |
| W06 | WebSocket handshake GET /_stcore/stream | the Rust server must accept a two-entry subprotocol header on a fresh load, select 'streamlit', and return the session id in NewSession.initialize.session_id | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/websocket_handshake` |
| W07 | WebSocket ForwardMsg lifecycle | the Rust server must emit the same message kinds and the same script_finished status value | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/frames` |
| W08 | WebSocket BackMsg rerun_script and WidgetStates | the Rust server must treat one BackMsg as exactly one rerun and must not receive form children before a submit | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/button_trace` |
| W09 | protobuf Element oneof names | the Rust proto must use the same oneof member names and numbers so the official frontend renders the elements | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/frames` |
| W10 | protobuf WidgetState value encoding | the Rust server must decode each widget kind from the same field and must keep widget ids stable across reruns | Python browser trace `tests/reference/reference-browser/closed-loop/trace.json#/frames` |
| W11 | WebSocket reconnect handshake /_stcore/stream | on a socket-only reconnect, recover the retained session identified by the opaque third subprotocol entry; a page refresh uses a fresh two-entry handshake and new session. Unknown UUID and non-UUID IDs must start a new server-selected session, as measured by the reference probe. Rust two-worker HTTP/WS regressions cover these lookups and stale-owner Drop protection. The session core, controlled-await ownership boundary, and final Rust browser subset have independently passed review: retained same-ID recovery with a subsequent increment, fresh-ID reset, and two-tab isolation. Original-socket fate and upstream expiry policy remain separate gaps; this is partial evidence, not full takeover or security-handshake compatibility. | Python [reconnect handshakes](../tests/reference/reference-browser/reconnect/trace-reconnect.json#/websocket_handshakes) record the first connection closing and the second using a third subprotocol entry with the same session ID; [post-reconnect observations](../tests/reference/reference-browser/reconnect/trace-reconnect.json#/steps) show Pulses 2 retained, then 2→3 with a successful server response on the new connection. Python [refresh handshakes](../tests/reference/reference-browser/refresh/trace-refresh.json#/websocket_handshakes) are the separate fresh-load reference; [Rust S1 observations](../tests/browser/rust-counter-s1/trace-counter.json#/steps) record the measured Rust subset. |
